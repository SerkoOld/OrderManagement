1.  The is no exception handling anywhere in the code 

2.  Input validation would make sense  

3.  Should allow to input empty value for numbers and treated as 0 

4.  As a suggestion input could be simplified by separating number of colors with delimiter 

5.  Do you want make pricing configurable? 

6.  Ability to cancel at any time would be nice to have 

7.  Class Shape could have a constructor. 

8.  Why AdditionalCharge is part of Shape class? Itâ€™s a feature of color not shape 

9.  Shape.Name and Price should be readonly 

10. There is no point of having SquarePrice, TrianglePrice, circlePrice as they duplicate Price property of base class

11. Order class probably should have a constructor and properies be set in it and made readonly   

12. Do we need some mechanism generate Order number? 

13. ToString is virtual method of object class and should use override modifier.  

14. All methods in main class probably should be private or protected 

15. Why Report classes derived from Order? Does not make any sense. Reports should have their own base class and user order as a parameter 

16. Invoice report could be derived from Painting report 

17. Functions in main class could be grouped better 

18. Attention to details in reports: Total is missing in invoice report, use of dashes instead of 0 

19. There is no really need for Square, Triangle and Circle classes as they only differ by Name and Price. Reports on another hand could use a proper base class. 

20. A lot of repeated code that could be incapsulated in base classes 

21. Some alternative example of that program could be found here https://github.com/Slava0467/MyOrderManager
