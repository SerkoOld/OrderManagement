1. Duplicated and scattered customers info appear in input paremeters of each method;
I would like to define a Class CustomerInfo contains all the customer related info and operations;
2. In concreate Report class, constructor should pass the value to 'this' rather than 'base'
3. In real life logic, Order should be property of Report, shouldn't be a parent of report
4. Duplicated methods appreas in the three Report classes, Better let the three reports inherit from an Abstract Report
4. I would liek make GenerateTable virtual to use later-binding.
5. I would like put Customer info into Order properties.
6. ToString should be overrided.
7.OrderNumber should be assigned a value.
8. Rename to GenerateInvoiceReport rather than InvoiceReport in Main, and so on so forth.
9. Only need one method Total() in Shape class, doesn't need Total method by colors
10. Unnecessary specified name such as CirclePrice, just use Price from base class, and so on.
11. As business requirement, AddtionalCharge doesn't care shape, need to only assign value at base class.
12. InvoiceReport details method need to be private
13. InvoiceReport lack of Total amount method
14. I would 'd like use Factory Method to implement Shape logic, decouple the input and create logic.
15.OrderXXXXInput is repeated pattern, I would like to put them into one method OrderShapeInput
